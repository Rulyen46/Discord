# Warcraftlogs Discord Webhook
Checks warcraftlogs every 15 sec and posts on discord if new logs are found

I recommend running this in something like [PM2](https://github.com/Unitech/pm2)

Run ```npm install``` in the folder to download all dependencies.

**Edit the json file with your information and remember to rename the file to "config.json"**
